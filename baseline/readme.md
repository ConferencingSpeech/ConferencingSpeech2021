# Details
Preparation files before training and inference:

    1. Generate training configuration file "./wav_list/tr/linear_100.lst" (Because the full amount of data occupies too much space, so we mix them dynamicly when training) and "config_scp" parameter in the "./config/train.yaml". The format of the configuration file is as follows:
    
       clean_path start_time noise_path rir_path snr scale
       The train config file is generated by running "../simulation/mix_wav.py" (You can see "get_clean_chunk" and "get_mix_config" for details)
       
    2. Generate dev wav list like "./wav_list/cv/linear_20.lst" and then put the dev data in the corresponding directory ./dev/xxx/{mix, ref}. After that, please modify the 
        "wav_scp", "mix_dir", "ref_dir" parameters in the "./config/train.yaml".
        The validition config file only contains basename of data, which is generated by running "../simulation/mix_wav.py" (You can search "utt_id")
        
    3. If you want to run the test code, please generate inference wav list like "./wav_list/tt/linear_20.lst" and then modify the "file_name" parameter in the "./config/test.yaml".
       The test config file only contains basename of data.
       
    4. All file in "wav_list" folder is just a sample for you to run the baseline scripts. If you want to reproduce the baseline result, please use "train_simu_{circle, linear, 
        non_uniform}.config" in dropbox

Training the model:

    1. If you want to adjust the network parameters and the path of the training file, please modify the "./config/train.yaml" file.
    
    2. Training Command
        python train.py -conf ./config/train.yaml

Test the model:

    1. If you want to adjust the path of the inferencing file, please modify the "./config/test.yaml" file.
    
    2: Inference Command
        python test.py -conf ./config/test.yaml

In the train yaml file:

    conf['train']['checkpoint'] means the path to save experimental model

In the inference yaml file:

    conf['test']['checkpoint'] means the path to load experimental model
    conf['save']['dir'] means the path to save generated wav
